## Study Area

Briefly describe the geographic area (e.g., “Central Seattle, WA, focusing on UW campus and surrounding neighborhoods.”).

## Zoom Levels

- Basemap tiles: z8–z16  
- Thematic tiles: z10–z16  
- Combined tiles: z10–z16  
- Themed tiles: z11–z17  

(Adjust to your actual export values.)

## Tile Sets

1. **Basemap (Tile set 1)**  
   Custom monochrome basemap based on Mapbox tiles, recolored for subtle background context.

2. **Thematic layer (Tile set 2)**  
   Thematic tiles built from my own geospatial dataset (describe data + symbolization).

3. **Combined layer (Tile set 3)**  
   Pre‑rendered tiles combining the basemap and thematic layer for a single integrated view.

4. **Themed layer (Tile set 4)**  
   Map designed around the theme (e.g., UW / Pride / Black History Month) using specific color palette, icons, and labels.
